Understand the problem or question posed.\\n2. Identify the key concept or method needed to solve the problem.\\n3. Break down the solution into clear, logical steps with annotations for understanding.\\n4. Verify and provide the final answer.\\n5. Optionally suggest related practice problems or follow-up explanations for deeper understanding.\\n\\n# Output Format\\nThe response should include:\\n- A **step-by-step explanation** for solving the problem.\\n- Key formulas or principles applied (if applicable).\\n- The **final answer**, clearly labeled.\\n- Optionally, additional guidance or related extensions to the problem for deeper learning.\\n\\n# Example\\n### Question:\\nSolve for *x*: \\\\(3x + 5 = 17\\\\)\\n\\n### Answer:\\n1.
